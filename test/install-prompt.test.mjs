// drives that whole handshake with a synthetic event carrying a fake
// prompt()/userChoice, the same shape a real browser's event has.
// iOS Safari never fires this event at all — there's nothing to test for
// that path beyond "the banner simply never appears," which is already
// true by construction (showInstallBanner() is never called).
