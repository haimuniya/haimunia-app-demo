// Bug fix, reported with two screenshots: tapping directly on a stepper's
// number (not the +/- buttons) reset it to 0 and stole focus before a
// keystroke could land, making it look like you couldn't type a number in
// at all. Root cause: the stepper's own <input> carries the same
// data-action as its +/- buttons (so the generic getFieldValue/setFieldState
// plumbing works for both), and the click dispatcher's "step" branch didn't
// distinguish between them — a click on the input itself fell into the same
// dir*step arithmetic as a real +/- tap, with el.dataset.dir undefined
// (NaN), which clampField() floored to the field's min. This affects the
// shared stepper mechanism, so it's not app-tab-specific — this test drives
// it through the EMOM builder screen from the report, but the fix
// (app.js: only el.classList.contains("stepper-btn") reaches the step
// arithmetic) is in the one shared click dispatcher branch every stepper
// in the app goes through.
