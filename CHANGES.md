# Gate community sign-up behind an invite code, and fix an admin self-lockout bug found along the way — 2026-08-27

Anyone who found the demo URL could sign in with any email and create a
community profile. New migration `supabase/migrations/202608270003_invite_gate.sql`
closes that: `invite_codes` (one shared code per role, member/coach) plus
`invite_redemptions` (one row per user, written only by the new
`redeem_invite_code()` RPC — no direct client insert path). `profiles_insert_self`
now requires a redemption on file before a profile can be created at all.
Community tab shows a new "enter invite code" step ahead of the profile
form whenever a signed-in user hasn't redeemed one yet.

The end state discussed for this is three access tiers — admin (full
access), coach (scoped to their own relevant classes/members), member —
but "coach" doesn't have a data model for what "their relevant" means
yet. So a coach-code redemption is deliberately just a label right now
(`invite_redemptions.role`), not wired to `is_admin` or any elevated
access — avoids locking in "coach == full admin" as the real design
before the actual scoping work happens. Full admin stays a manual,
dashboard-only grant, same as before this migration.

Bug found while writing the above: `profiles_update_self`'s RLS check
required `is_admin = false` on *every* update — meaning the moment any
profile actually had `is_admin = true`, that account could never save its
own profile again (any edit would get rejected, since the resulting row
still has `is_admin = true`). This would have locked out the very first
real admin account. Fixed with a trigger (`protect_is_admin`) that pins
`is_admin` to its previously stored value on every update, so no
client-side path — invite code, profile-edit upsert, or otherwise — can
ever change it after creation; the update policy's `is_admin = false`
requirement was then unnecessary and removed.

5 new tests in `test/community-invite-gate.test.mjs`. 145/145 pass.

# Lock down an anon read leak found by live-testing the previous migration — 2026-08-27

Found immediately after applying `202608270001_community_growth.sql`
against the live project and testing it with no login at all (just the
publishable key, no session): `activity_pings`, `announcements`,
`weekly_challenges`, and the `community_streaks` view were all readable
by anyone, no auth required. `activity_pings` in particular was designed
to be self-only — its own RLS policies say so — but RLS never got a
chance to run, because the `anon` role had a standing table-level SELECT
grant that bypassed the question entirely. Writes were still safe: a test
insert into `announcements` correctly failed on the RLS policy.

Cause: this Supabase project has a default privilege that auto-grants
`anon` (and `authenticated`) SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on any newly
created table. `202608260001`'s blanket `revoke all ... from anon,
authenticated` only covered tables that existed at the moment it ran —
every table `202608270001` created afterward silently picked the default
back up, since nothing in that migration re-revoked it.

New migration `202608270002_lock_anon_defaults.sql`: revokes the leaked
access on the four objects above, and — so this can't repeat itself the
next time a migration adds a table — runs `alter default privileges in
schema public revoke select, insert, update, delete on tables from anon,
authenticated`, which stops the auto-grant from applying to anything
created from this point forward. Every table this app needs already gets
an explicit `grant ... to authenticated` alongside its own RLS policy, so
nothing legitimate depended on the default.

1 new static-assertion test locks in that this migration exists and does
what it says.

# Close the reactions RLS gap, and add achievement sharing, streaks, announcements, and a weekly challenge — 2026-08-27

Two threads from the earlier audit of this repo's community layer, done
together: closing out the remaining credibility gaps it found, and
building the growth features discussed for pitching this to the box
manager.

## Credibility fixes

- **CSP `frame-ancestors`**: the audit flagged this directive as dropped
  compared to a "proper" CSP. On inspection this isn't fixable as stated —
  `frame-ancestors`/`X-Frame-Options` are spec-ignored when delivered via
  `<meta>`, only a real HTTP response header enforces them, and GitHub
  Pages has no way to set custom response headers on static files. Adding
  the directive back to the `<meta>` tag would be inert, not a fix. Left
  the file's own comment expanded to say this plainly instead of silently
  re-adding dead config — real clickjacking mitigation here would need
  moving off GitHub Pages. For what it's worth, the production app ships
  no CSP at all, so this demo is still strictly ahead on every directive
  that *does* work via `<meta>`.
- **Reactions RLS gap**: `reactions_visible`/`reactions_insert_self` only
  checked that the referenced post *existed*, not that it was still
  visible to the viewer — a deleted post, a blocked author, or a
  followers-only post from someone you don't follow all leaked reaction
  rows even though `posts_feed_select` correctly hid the post itself. New
  migration factors the exact visibility rule `posts_feed_select` already
  uses into `post_visible_to_viewer()` and both reaction policies now call
  it, so the two rules can't drift apart again.
- **README.md**: rewrote it — it still described the old mock-data-only
  preview ("runs entirely on mock data today... not live for real
  members"), which stopped being true once this became a real
  Supabase-backed PWA.

## New features

New migration `supabase/migrations/202608270001_community_growth.sql`
(on top of the existing `202608260001_community_foundation.sql` — **must
be run against the live Supabase project before these features work; this
session had no CLI/service-role access to apply it directly**):

- **Achievement-unlock sharing**: `workout_posts.source_type` now accepts
  `'achievement'` alongside the existing strength/WOD entry types. A new
  share button appears per newly-earned badge directly in the existing
  celebration popup (`celebrationShare` in `index.html`, wired in
  `showCelebration()` in `app.js`) — only when the community layer
  reports the athlete signed in (`window.isCommunitySignedIn()`).
  Achievement unlocks aren't durable local records the way strength/WOD
  entries are, so this is a transient share offer at the moment of
  unlock rather than an addition to `communityShareCandidates()`.
- **Activity streaks**: new `activity_pings` table (one row per user per
  day, self-insert/self-select only — raw per-day presence stays
  private) plus a `community_streaks` view that aggregates a
  gaps-and-islands current-streak calculation across every user and
  exposes only the resulting number to the whole community. The view is
  deliberately *not* `security_invoker`, so it can read across
  `activity_pings` rows RLS would otherwise restrict to their own owner —
  the raw dates never leave the table, only the streak length does.
- **Coach announcements**: new `announcements` table, admin-only insert
  (checked against `profiles.is_admin`), readable by every signed-in
  member. Composer form appears in the Community tab only for admins.
- **Weekly box-wide challenge**: new `weekly_challenges` table (admin
  sets a title, a `comparison_key`, and a date range) plus a
  `weekly_challenge_leaderboard` view that reads straight from the
  existing `workout_posts` — reusing `posts_feed_select`'s visibility
  rules via `security_invoker`, so a challenge leaderboard never shows a
  post its own visibility settings would otherwise hide from that viewer.
- **Coach "who hasn't logged recently"**: new `coach_inactive_members()`
  function, security-definer with an internal admin check (raises if the
  caller isn't an admin profile) rather than widening `activity_pings`'
  own RLS — keeps raw per-day activity data admin-only without a second
  parallel table.

7 new static-assertion tests in `test/community-growth.test.mjs` (matching
the existing pattern in `test/community-foundation.test.mjs` — no live
Postgres to run migrations against in this test suite) plus 2 new
jsdom tests in `test/achievements.test.mjs` covering the celebration
share button's visibility and click wiring.

# Isolate this demo's browser storage from the production app — 2026-08-27

Found by an independent audit: this demo and the real production app
(`haimuniya.github.io/haimunia-app/`) are served from the same GitHub
Pages origin — just different paths — and browser storage (IndexedDB,
localStorage, sessionStorage, Cache Storage) is scoped per-origin, not
per-path. This demo was using the production app's exact identifiers:

- IndexedDB: `DB_NAME` was `"box-log-db"`, identical to production.
  A real member whose browser had opened both URLs would have this
  demo's community/social code reading and able to publish their real
  local training data.
- localStorage/sessionStorage: every key used the bare `"haimunia:"`
  prefix (or the legacy `"boxlog:"` one), same as production.
- Cache Storage: the service worker's cache name shared production's
  `"haimunia-v..."` prefix — and its activate handler deleted *any*
  cache that wasn't its own current version, which would have deleted
  the production app's cached assets outright the first time both
  service workers had ever run in the same browser.

Every identifier above is now demo-specific (`"haimunia-demo-db"`,
`"haimunia-demo:*"` keys, `"haimunia-demo-v..."` cache names), and the
service worker's cleanup now only ever deletes caches matching its own
prefix instead of "anything that isn't me." `manifest.json`'s `id`/
`start_url`/`scope` were checked too — those are relative URLs that
already resolve differently per path, so no change was needed there.

4 new tests in `test/storage-isolation.test.mjs` lock this in: the
IndexedDB name, every storage key actually written during real app
flows, a source-level sweep of all four JS files for any lingering
production identifier, and the cache-cleanup scoping logic itself (not
just its name). Full suite: 130/130 (126 existing + 4 new), green.

# Fix: WOD tab's רישום/היסטוריה pill highlight not following the subtab — 2026-08-25

Reported by the user with a screenshot: after switching WOD subtabs,
היסטוריה stayed highlighted while the רישום (log) form was actually
showing underneath. Root cause: the pill buttons are rendered once in
renderWodTab(), which only runs on a full top-level tab switch —
switch-wod-subtab's handler only ever called renderWodContent() (swaps
#wodContent's innerHTML), so the content switched correctly but the
highlight never followed it. Fixed by having the handler also update the
two buttons' active/aria-selected state directly, same pattern already
used for the WOD builder's format chips.

# Workout format support, sub-tasks A (WOD builder half) + B + D + extras — 2026-08-25

Finishes the workout-format-support spec: the WOD builder's own duration
toggle (the other half of sub-task A), blocks/supersets (B), EMOM (D), and
the two lower-priority extras (time cap, partner tag). Sub-task C was
already covered by the existing ladder feature (confirmed in the previous
round). Plain single-exercise logging, and every previously-shipped
feature, is unaffected — re-verified via the full test suite and browser
checks after each addition below.

- **WOD builder duration toggle.** A movement checked in the builder can be
  marked "reps" or "duration" (a reps/duration chip pair per movement,
  reusing the toggle from the Log tab). Only changes the free-text
  description the builder generates (`builderMovementsToDesc`) — WOD
  entries themselves have never stored structured per-movement data for any
  format except EMOM (see below).
- **Supersets and A/B/C/D block labels.** Extends the existing ladder
  mechanism rather than replacing it: a ladder can now optionally take a
  second exercise (`setLadderPartner`), turning it into a superset —
  alternating rounds between exactly two exercises under one `groupId`,
  switched between via two pills (`switchLadderExercise`) instead of the
  normal exercise picker (which still ends it, same as before). An
  optional `blockLabel` chip (A/B/C/D) tags the whole group, carried by
  every round. The calendar day view and Log tab's running list both
  derive "is this a superset" from the group's own data (more than one
  distinct exerciseId), not from in-progress session state, so a finished
  superset displays correctly regardless of how it was built.
- **EMOM.** A fourth WOD scoreType, built through the same
  reusable/named WOD builder as Fran or Grace — not a one-off freeform
  entry. Unlike every other format, an EMOM's movement rotation
  (`emomMovements`/`emomTargetReps`/`emomMinutes`) is structured data on the
  WOD record itself, because the log form needs it to render one reps
  field per movement, prefilled from that WOD's own targets and resized
  automatically when switching between differently-shaped EMOM WODs.
  Explicitly out of scope per the confirmed spec: no cross-attempt scoring
  — `bestWodScore`/the History tab's PR chart both skip EMOM entirely
  rather than fabricate a comparison that doesn't mean anything for it.
- **Time cap and partner tag.** Two small, independent additions: an
  optional reference-only time cap on a WOD (shown in the log header,
  never enforced or scored), and a free-text partner tag per WOD entry
  ("with Dana") shown next to Rx/Scaled in history and the calendar.

Also fixed along the way: the strength Log tab's est-1RM/barbell-visual
live-update on raw keystroke input wasn't duration-mode-aware (a latent gap
from the previous round, caught while wiring the same live-update path for
the new duration stepper), and picking an exact-name search match in the
exercise picker via Enter didn't end an active ladder the way clicking the
same movement's button already did — both now consistent.

# Workout format support, sub-task A: duration/hold entries — 2026-08-25

A structured spec came in covering four workout-logging gaps that BTWB/
SugarWOD-style apps handle poorly: timed holds, multi-part A/B/C blocks
with supersets, pyramid rep schemes, and EMOMs with rotating movements.
Pyramid schemes turned out to already be covered by the existing ladder
feature (confirmed, not assumed — skipped as its own sub-task). This round
covers sub-task A only; blocks/supersets and EMOM are separate, larger
changes staged for their own rounds.

- **Duration/hold entries in the strength Log tab.** A new reps/duration
  toggle next to the exercise picker switches the whole entry form: reps
  mode is exactly what existed before (unchanged), duration mode swaps the
  reps stepper for a duration-in-seconds one and skips the barbell-plate
  visual and bar-weight row (neither applies to a timed hold). Weight stays
  available in duration mode for weighted carries/holds, defaulting to 0
  for a bodyweight hold. `sanitizeEntry` gained a `type` ("reps" |
  "duration") discriminator and a `durationSeconds` field — every entry
  from before this change has no `type`, which sanitizes to "reps"
  automatically, so existing data and the plain reps flow are unaffected.
- Selecting an exercise now defaults the toggle to whatever it was last
  logged as (a hold-only movement like a plank stays in duration mode),
  and editing an existing entry restores its own type regardless of
  whatever the toggle currently shows.
- PR tracking, the History tab's per-exercise chart, and the achievement
  system's per-category PR counter all now correctly separate duration
  entries from reps entries — a hold-only movement reports "no 1RM" (not a
  phantom 0kg one), and its History chart plots hold time instead of
  est1RM. Recent-history, the calendar day view, and ladder-round display
  all format each entry by its own type, so a mixed history (an exercise
  logged both ways over time) renders correctly everywhere.
- Ladders and duration entries compose: a ladder can be a sequence of
  progressively longer holds, same as it can be a sequence of different
  weight/rep rungs. Switching the reps/duration toggle mid-ladder ends it,
  same as switching exercise or date already did.

# Roadmap round: notifications, onboarding, streaks, recent history, session notes — 2026-08-25

A 10-phase roadmap came in for "look at every tab." Two phases turned out
to already be substantially satisfied by existing code (found during
research, not assumed): the WOD tab's custom + Girls/Heroes-benchmark entry
paths, and the Log tab's last-session reference (which the immediately
preceding round had already turned into a tap-to-prefill button). Phase 9
depended on a "Goals" feature that doesn't exist anywhere in the codebase —
asked directly, skipped for this round. Phase 8 (build-then-commit a whole
session before saving anything) is a real redesign of the save flow the
user themselves flagged as needing its own planning pass — deferred to a
dedicated follow-up rather than bundled in with seven other features.

This round: expanded `WOD_LIBRARY` with 7 more evergreen benchmarks (Kelly,
Eva, Barbara, Filthy Fifty, Michael, Danny, Badger). Everything below is new.

- **Update notifications.** A small `RELEASE_NOTES` list (separate from
  this file — short, Hebrew, user-facing) backs both a one-time "מה חדש"
  popup shown to returning users after a real update, and a persistent bell
  icon in the header with an unread badge. A genuinely fresh install sees
  neither — nothing to catch up on; existing devices from before this
  shipped get silently backfilled so they're never shown a changelog
  retroactively.
- **First-time onboarding.** A short one-screen walkthrough (what each tab
  is for) shown once, immediately after the very first welcome/name modal —
  never for a device that already has data or a name.
- **Recent history at the point of entry.** Picking an exercise or WOD now
  shows up to 5 real logged attempts from the last 14 days, not just the
  single most-recent one. No warm-up logic anywhere in it — every row is an
  actual saved set.
- **Streak indicator.** Consecutive days (strength set or WOD, either
  counts) with at least one entry, shown next to the header's date. Reuses
  the exact same day-has-an-entry check the calendar's dots already used
  (extracted into one shared `hasAnyEntryOn`), so the two can never disagree
  about what counts as a trained day. Today not being logged yet doesn't
  break it — just isn't counted until it is.
- **Per-day session note.** One free-text field per calendar date ("how did
  the session feel"), distinct from the existing per-WOD-entry scaling
  notes. Surfaced from the Calendar day view.

Files changed: `app.js`, `index.html`. New `test/roadmap-features.test.mjs`
(7 tests: version comparison, fresh-install vs. existing-device bootstrap
paths, streak counting across gaps, the 14-day/5-item recent-history cap,
session-note round-trip). New `scripts/browser-check/roadmap.mjs` — real
Chromium session driving all five features end to end, including the
session note surviving a navigate-away-and-back round trip. `boot-smoke.mjs`
and `ladder.mjs` re-verified for regressions; their shared `dismissWelcomeModal`
helper updated to also close the new onboarding modal, since every
fresh-context check now hits it.

# Prefill from last session — 2026-08-25

Reframed what this app actually is: filled in after a workout (from memory
or a whiteboard scribble), not used live during one — which rules out
things like a rest timer, but means entry *speed* for reconstructing a
session is what matters. Progressive overload means today's numbers are
usually close to last time's, not random, yet the "אימון אחרון" (last
session) card was informational only — you still dragged the steppers from
scratch every time.

It's now a button: tapping it copies that exercise's last weight, reps,
and sets straight into the steppers (and the barbell visual updates with
them). A small repeat icon signals it's interactive, distinct from the
adjacent 1RM card which stays informational.

Files changed: `app.js`. Two new tests in `test/app-flow.test.mjs` (prefill
pulls the right exercise's history, not whatever was left over from a
different one; no-op when there's no history yet). Verified visually in a
real Chromium session — steppers and barbell both update from one tap.

---

# Committed browser-check scripts — 2026-08-25

Three real bugs this session (self-reload on first install, PR celebration
firing on every ladder rung, editing mid-ladder not ending it) only
surfaced through real-Chromium testing — jsdom doesn't implement Service
Worker lifecycle or real DOM event timing, so the committed `npm test`
suite structurally can't catch this class of bug. Those checks previously
lived as scratch scripts, rebuilt from scratch each time.

`scripts/browser-check/` — a separate package (own `package.json`, own
`playwright` dependency, own lockfile) so the main app's dependency tree
stays untouched:

- `npm run setup` once (installs Playwright + downloads Chromium)
- `npm run check:boot` — fresh load, fonts actually loaded, no self-reload,
  all 4 tabs switch, no console errors
- `npm run check:ladder` — a real 5-round working-up ladder end to end:
  toggle, save, celebration suppression, calendar grouping, edit, delete,
  finish
- `npm run check:update` — the Service Worker update lifecycle (first
  install doesn't self-reload; an update hidden from view auto-applies
  silently; one landing mid-session shows the banner and applies on the
  next visibility regain). Local-only — it edits `sw.js` on disk to
  simulate a new deploy landing, reverted when it's done.
- `npm run check:all` runs all three, stopping at the first failure

Each defaults to a throwaway local static server over the working tree
(uncommitted changes included); `TARGET_URL=<url>` points any of them at a
deployed site instead, e.g. to verify a push actually landed.

Not part of the main test suite or any CI — on-demand only, the same way
this session ran them by hand throughout.

---

# Gap-hunting pass — 2026-08-25

Went back through the app looking for rough edges, focused on the ladder
feature since it's newest. Found and fixed one real interaction bug, plus
an accessibility gap.

- **Bug: editing an unrelated entry mid-ladder didn't end it.**
  `startEditEntry()` (the pencil icon on any set in history/calendar)
  switches the selected exercise and log date, exactly like picking a new
  movement or changing the date already did — but unlike those two, it
  never called `endLadder()`. Editing an old set from a different exercise
  while a ladder was running left the toggle still advertising an active
  ladder for the wrong context. Fixed — with one deliberate exception:
  editing one of the *active ladder's own* rounds (fixing a typo in set 3)
  does **not** end it, so correcting a mistake mid-session doesn't strand
  you from adding set 6 afterward.
- **Accessibility:** the ladder progress text ("5 סטים נרשמו · הבא: 6")
  now carries `aria-live="polite"`, matching the pattern already used for
  the storage-error and import-result messages.

Files changed: `app.js`. Two new regression tests in `test/app-flow.test.mjs`
cover both the "unrelated edit ends it" and "own-round edit doesn't" cases;
the fix was verified in a real Chromium session too — my own test script
had exercised this exact path without realizing the tested behavior was
wrong until this pass looked closer.

---

# Ladder UX pass — 2026-08-25

The ladder toggle worked but was easy to miss (a small text link) and gave
no feedback on what it actually did — no indication of which set you were
on, the save button never changed to reflect it, and finishing without
switching tabs first left stale state on screen (a real bug: `endLadder()`
via the explicit toggle never called `render()`, so the UI kept showing
"finish ladder" and the old round list until something else happened to
re-render).

- Toggle is now a full-width bordered button (matching the app's existing
  "+ add new" prompt pattern) with a ladder icon and a plain-language
  subtitle when off. While active, it shows live progress inline — "5 סטים
  נרשמו · הבא: 6" — instead of requiring a scroll down to the chip list to
  know where you are.
- The Save button's own label now changes too: "הוספת סט 6 לסולם — Strict
  Press" instead of the generic "רישום סט", so it's explicit that tapping
  it adds another rung rather than finishing anything.
- Fixed: tapping "סיום" now re-renders immediately (previously required
  switching tabs to see the toggle/list actually clear) and shows a brief
  confirmation ("הסולם נשמר — 5 סטים") reusing the existing footer message
  mechanism.
- Fixed a copy bug: the empty-ladder hint referenced "the blue button" —
  the save button is actually the brand's orange/energy color, never blue.

Files changed: `app.js`. Verified with the full test suite plus a real
Chromium session driving the exact flow (toggle on, 5 different-weight
rounds, finish without switching tabs, confirm the render and message).

---

# Service worker: stop self-reloading on first install, apply updates without reopening — 2026-08-25

Two bugs in the update-delivery path, found while chasing a report that the
new ladder feature "wasn't showing up."

**Critical: every fresh visit was reloading itself ~1-2s after opening.**
`self.clients.claim()` in the service worker's `activate` handler fires
`controllerchange` even on a page's very first-ever install — not just on a
real update swap. The app's `controllerchange` listener reloaded
unconditionally, so any in-progress input (the welcome-modal name field, a
weight being adjusted, a ladder mid-session) could get silently wiped a
second or two into every single visit. `applyUpdate()` now sets a
`swapRequested` flag right before asking a waiting worker to take over, and
the listener only reloads when that flag is set — ignoring the incidental
first-claim event. Confirmed via a real Chromium session: before the fix, a
fresh load always fired a second navigation within ~2s; after, zero.

**Updates now apply without a manual reopen, in the common case.** Previously
every update needed an explicit tap on the "עדכון חדש זמין" banner. Since the
phone screen locking between sets already fires `visibilitychange`, updates
now apply automatically the moment the page regains visibility after being
backgrounded — no banner, no reopening needed. The banner still appears as a
fallback only when an update lands while the page has stayed continuously
visible (reloading then could drop unsaved input), and applies automatically
on the next visibility regain even if the banner is never tapped.

Files changed: `app.js`. No test suite coverage for either fix — both are
real Service Worker lifecycle behavior that jsdom doesn't implement, so they
were verified with a real Chromium session (Playwright) against a local
static server instead; see the session's own scratch scripts for the pattern
if this code changes again.

# Ladder logging — 2026-08-25

Working-up ladders (e.g. Press: 6 reps @ 60, 5 @ 70, 4 @ 80, 3 @ 85, 3 @ 90 —
each rung a different weight *and* rep count) didn't fit the "Sets" field,
which only means "N identical sets at one weight/reps." Saving each rung
separately already worked, but showed up as unrelated rows.

- Entries gained an optional `groupId` (`sanitizeEntry`) tying together the
  rows saved in one ladder session. Existing records get `groupId: null` —
  no behavior change for anyone who never uses this.
- New toggle in the log tab: "רישום סולם" turns it on (generates a session
  id), every Save while it's on joins that session, a running list of the
  rounds so far shows underneath with a per-round remove. "סיום סולם" turns
  it off. Switching exercise or changing the log date auto-ends it, so a set
  can't silently misjoin the wrong session.
- The calendar day view groups a ladder's rows into one card (exercise name
  + PR flame shown once) — but every rung keeps its own edit/delete, so a
  specific set stays individually correctable.
- The full-screen "PR!" celebration popup is suppressed while a ladder is
  active — an ascending ladder routinely beats the previous best est1RM on
  every rung, which meant one popup per rung. The inline barbell flash still
  shows a PR immediately; the popup resumes normally once the ladder ends.
- Nothing else changed: PR detection, `bestEst1RM`/`repRecordFor`, the
  progress chart, and export/import all still treat every round as its own
  entry, same as before — a ladder's rungs just happen to share a tag.

Files changed: `app.js`. Tests: `test/sanitizers.test.mjs` (groupId
round-trip), `test/app-flow.test.mjs` (a real 5-round ladder end to end,
including surviving a simulated reload, and exercise-switch auto-ending it).

---

# "Next level" pass — 2026-08-25

Follow-up to the review below: closed out the "left for you" items from the
2.8.0 pass, plus an accessibility sweep, an install prompt, and the first
committed automated test suite.

Files changed: `app.js`, `index.html`, `sw.js`. New: `assets/fonts/*` (13
files), `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/sync-version.mjs`,
`test/*`, `.gitignore`. `manifest.json` unchanged.

Verified with `npm test` (Node's built-in test runner, jsdom + fake-indexeddb,
dev-only — nothing here ships to the deployed site): **19 assertions**, all
passing, covering sanitizers/XSS-escaping, the add-movement → log-a-set →
simulated-reload round trip, and the import path (valid backup, `__proto__`
category neutralization, wrong-app-id rejection, oversized-file rejection).

## Self-hosted fonts, tightened CSP

- Downloaded the exact Rubik (400/600/700/800/900, latin+hebrew subsets),
  JetBrains Mono (500/700), and Anton (400) `.woff2` files Google's own CSS2
  API serves for this app, into `./assets/fonts/`. Verified woff2 magic bytes
  on all 13 files.
- Replaced the Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html` with local `@font-face`
  rules using the same `unicode-range` values, so subsetting behavior is
  unchanged.
- CSP's `style-src`/`font-src` no longer allow any external origin — the app
  now makes zero third-party network requests, full stop.
- `sw.js` precaches all 13 font files, so typography no longer degrades
  offline.

## Accessibility pass

Previously: 2 `aria-*`/`role` attributes in the whole app. Now: 120 across
`index.html` + `app.js`. Added:
- `role="tablist"`/`"tab"`/`aria-selected` on the main tab bar and the WOD
  sub-tab bar, kept in sync on every tab switch.
- `role="dialog"` `aria-modal` `aria-labelledby` on all 6 modals (picker, WOD
  picker, WOD builder, achievements, celebration, welcome), `aria-label` on
  every icon-only close button.
- `aria-label` on every search input, date input, and icon-only edit/delete
  button; `aria-label` on the stepper +/− buttons and value fields.
- `role="radiogroup"`/`"radio"` + `aria-checked` on the WOD format picker, bar
  weight picker, Rx/Scaled toggle, and theme picker; `role="checkbox"`
  `aria-checked` on the WOD-builder movement checklist rows.
- `role="status"`/`aria-live` on the update banner, install banner, loading
  screen, storage-error footer note, and import-result message.

## Version sync automated

`APP_VERSION` (app.js) and `SW_VERSION` (sw.js) were kept in sync by hand.
`scripts/sync-version.mjs` now does it — `npm run sync-version` after bumping
`APP_VERSION`, `npm run check-version` (or `npm test`) fails loudly if they
ever drift.

## Install prompt

Custom "Add to Home Screen" banner (`app.js`: `beforeinstallprompt` handling;
`index.html`: `#installBanner`), styled like the update banner but with the
brand stripe instead of solid energy color so the two are visually distinct.
Shows once per session, steps aside if an update banner is showing, never
shows if already installed. iOS Safari doesn't fire `beforeinstallprompt`, so
the banner simply never appears there — no regression, just no improvement
for that platform.

## Export privacy notice

One line under the export/import buttons: the backup file is plaintext JSON
and includes name, bodyweight history, and full training log.

## Left undone (by design, not oversight)

- **Server response headers** (HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `Permissions-Policy`, real `frame-ancestors`) — GitHub Pages can't set
  custom headers; would need Cloudflare or another host in front. Decided
  against for now: no backend, no data leaves the device, so this was already
  low real-world risk.

---

# Security & hardening pass — v2.7.0 → v2.8.0

Files changed: `app.js`, `index.html`, `sw.js`. `manifest.json` unchanged.

Verified with two suites run against the real app booted in a DOM
(jsdom + fake-indexeddb): **58 security assertions** and **59 functional
regression assertions**, all passing.

## Critical

### 1. XSS via unescaped HTML attributes
`esc()` was applied to text nodes but skipped on several attribute values.

- `renderStepper()` — `data-field`, `data-action`, `data-step`, `data-min`,
  `value`, and the label are now all escaped. `field` is a user-authored
  movement name from the WOD builder.
- `data-id` on `pick-movement`, `pick-wod`, `select-history`,
  `select-wod-history`, `delete-entry`, `delete-wod-entry`; `data-date` on
  `cal-select-day`.
- `CATEGORY_LABELS[cat] || cat` and `style="background:${CATEGORY_COLORS[cat]}"`
  — replaced with `catLabel()` / `catColor()`, which use `hasOwnProperty` and
  fall back to safe defaults, then escaped.
- The `render()` catch-block printed `err.message` raw into `innerHTML`.

The `id` and `category` sinks were reachable from an imported backup file,
which is the vector that mattered.

### 2. Import accepted arbitrary data
`importDataFromFile()` checked only that `record.id` was truthy.

- Added `sanitizeMovement` / `sanitizeCustomWod` / `sanitizeEntry` /
  `sanitizeWodEntry` / `sanitizeBodyweight`. Each rebuilds the record field by
  field from a whitelist: `cleanId` (charset `A-Za-z0-9._:-`), `cleanStr`
  (control chars stripped, length capped), `cleanNum` (clamped both ends),
  `cleanISODate`, `cleanTs`. Nothing from the file is ever stored as-is.
- `data.app` and `data.version` are now verified (they were written on export
  and ignored on import).
- 25 MB file cap, 20,000-record-per-list cap.
- Confirmation prompt before merging, and a `box-log-rollback-<date>.json`
  auto-backup is downloaded first, since the merge can't be undone in-app.
- Result message reports imported / rejected / failed-to-save counts.
- New `reloadFromDb()` re-sanitizes on every load, so records written by an
  older build of the app can't poison the render path either.

### 3. Prototype pollution → persistent DoS
`byCategory[m.category]` with `category: "__proto__"` resolved to
`Object.prototype`, and `.push` threw a `TypeError`. Because the record was
persisted, the picker crashed on every load until "clear all data".

- `byCategory` and `builderMovements` now use `Object.create(null)` via `bag()`.
- `catColor` / `catLabel` guard lookups with `hasOwnProperty`.
- The category whitelist in the sanitizer closes the entry point.

## Hardening

- **CSP added** to `index.html` — `script-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`,
  `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, `connect-src 'self'`.
  `'unsafe-inline'` is in `style-src` only (inline `style=` attributes; there is
  no inline `<script>` anywhere). `frame-ancestors` is in the meta tag but is
  ignored there — **set it as a real response header on the host.**
- `<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">`.
- Google Fonts left in place but documented inline with the exact steps to
  self-host; `preconnect` to `fonts.gstatic.com` was missing and is now added.
  Self-hosting is the one item I couldn't do for you — it needs the woff2 files.

---

## Service worker (rewritten)

- **Origin-gated.** It previously cached every successful GET from any origin,
  forever. Now same-origin only, and only app-shell paths are written back.
- **`Promise.allSettled` over individual `cache.add()`** instead of `addAll()`,
  which failed the entire install on one missing file.
- **Added the maskable icons** to `ASSETS` (referenced in the manifest, absent
  from the precache list).
- **Navigation handling with `ignoreSearch: true`** — this is what makes the
  manifest shortcuts (`./index.html?tab=add`) work offline; exact-URL matching
  missed on the query string.
- **`skipWaiting()` removed from install.** A new worker parks in `waiting`; the
  update banner posts `SKIP_WAITING` and the page reloads on `controllerchange`.
  Previously the new worker took over while the old `app.js` was still running.
- Navigation preload enabled; `SW_VERSION` bumped to 2.8.0 alongside
  `APP_VERSION`.

---

## Smaller fixes

- **Pinch-zoom restored.** `user-scalable=no` / `maximum-scale=1` removed from
  the viewport meta, and the `touchmove` / `gesture*` blockers removed from
  `app.js` (WCAG 1.4.4). The double-tap-zoom suppression is kept, since that one
  fires by accident on the steppers.
- **Numeric inputs bounded at both ends** via `clampField()` — previously only a
  floor. `1e12` in a weight box no longer propagates into app state.
- **`maxlength` on every text input**, plus `cleanStr()` caps in JS (names 80,
  notes 300).
- **IDs now use `crypto.randomUUID()`.** The old slug scheme stripped every
  non-`[a-z0-9]` character, so all Hebrew movement names collapsed to
  `custom--<timestamp>`.
- **`userName` moved from localStorage to IndexedDB** (with one-time migration).
  It's the only PII in the app and "clear all data" never touched it — it does
  now, and the welcome modal reappears. Same for the last-export marker.
- **Storage failures surfaced.** `noteStorageError()` distinguishes
  `QuotaExceededError` and shows it in red in the footer instead of silently
  swallowing it.
- `CSS.escape` via `cssSel()` on the two `querySelector` calls that interpolate
  a field name — these threw on any name containing a quote.
- `openDB()` now memoises its promise instead of reopening the DB per call.
- `URL.revokeObjectURL` deferred 30s so the download reliably starts.
- `mobile-web-app-capable` added next to the deprecated Apple variant.

## Left for you

1. **Self-host the fonts** and tighten the CSP to `font-src 'self'` /
   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`.
2. **Server response headers**: HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
   `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Permissions-Policy` denying
   camera/microphone/geolocation/usb, and `frame-ancestors 'none'` as a real
   header.
3. **Automate the version bump** — `APP_VERSION` in `app.js` and `SW_VERSION` in
   `sw.js` are still synced by hand. A missed bump means users stay on stale
   code, which is now a security concern and not just a UX one.
4. Exports are still plaintext JSON containing the name, bodyweight history, and
   full training log. Normal for a backup, but worth a line of UI text next to
   the export button.
# Community foundation and cloud sync — v3.0.0 — 2026-08-26

- Added a Supabase/PostgreSQL community backend migration with deny-by-default
  Row Level Security for private records, profiles, follows, blocks, workout
  posts, cheers, reports, and account-deletion requests.
- Added magic-link authentication, profiles, athlete discovery, following,
  a follower/public feed, explicit workout sharing, comparable-result views,
  reactions, reporting, blocking, and a 30-day deletion workflow.
- Existing and new workout records remain in IndexedDB for offline use. Cloud
  migration requires explicit consent, and an IndexedDB outbox retries writes
  after connectivity returns. Remote private records hydrate a new device.
- Social posts are sanitized snapshots: bodyweight, measurements, session and
  WOD notes, partner tags, email, and backups never enter the public post.
- Reconciled the unfinished working-tree regression pass: fixed edit identity
  corruption, stale ladder state, EMOM switching/input behavior, custom-WOD
  deletion, backup tests, text scaling, and tiered achievement artwork.
- Added setup, privacy, terms, and CI documentation. The Community tab remains
  in safe setup mode until `cloud-config.js` contains a project URL and public
  publishable key.
