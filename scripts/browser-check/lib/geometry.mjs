// Measurements that only exist in a real engine.
//
// The bugs these serve share a property that makes them invisible to the
// node suite: nothing about the DOM is wrong. `textContent` is byte-for-byte
// correct, the right elements exist, the right classes are on them. What is
// wrong is where the pixels land. jsdom has no layout — every rect it
// reports is 0×0 at (0,0) — so a unit test cannot fail on any of this, and
// the only honest place to assert it is Chromium.

// Reads the VISUAL (painted) order of the characters inside an element, as
// opposed to the logical order `textContent` returns.
//
// Why this is the only way to see a bidi reordering bug: the Unicode
// bidirectional algorithm never touches the DOM. A rep scheme written
// "21-15-9" is still the string "21-15-9" in the text node after the engine
// has decided to paint it as "9-15-21" at the far end of an RTL line.
// Logical order is preserved by definition; only geometry disagrees.
//
// Method: a Range over one character at a time, per text node, taking that
// character's painted rect. Characters are grouped into visual lines by the
// vertical midpoint of their rects (wrapping is normal here), and each line
// is sorted left-to-right by `rect.left`. The result is what a person
// looking at the screen actually reads, left to right, top to bottom.
//
// Zero-width and collapsed characters report empty rects and are skipped:
// they are exactly the isolation marks and whitespace collapses that carry
// no visual position, so including them would add characters a reader never
// sees. <bdi> itself contributes no characters at all.

// reaches a member as a different workout.
