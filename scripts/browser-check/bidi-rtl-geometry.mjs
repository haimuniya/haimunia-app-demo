// Bidi isolation, asserted the only way it can be: by measuring where the
// characters actually land.
//
// THE BUG. The app is `<html lang="he" dir="rtl">` end to end, and the
// training log is where mixed-script content is the norm rather than the
// exception - rep schemes ("21-15-9"), English movement names, weights
// ("43/30"), all typed into RTL Hebrew paragraphs. Interpolated bare, the
// Unicode bidirectional algorithm reorders those LTR runs against the
// paragraph and what is PAINTED stops matching what was typed. A coach's
//
//     21-15-9 Thrusters + Pull-ups. Rx 43/30 ק"ג.
//
// reached members with the rep scheme at the opposite end of the line; one
// audit persona read it as 9-15-21. That is why this is a safety bug and
// not a cosmetic one: not a garbled string a member notices and ignores,
// but a plausible, valid-looking, DIFFERENT workout they follow to the
// letter without ever knowing it is not the one that was written. Fixed in
// 3a85c76 (cloud.js, 46 sites) and d568aee (app.js) by wrapping each LINE
// in <bdi>.
//
// THE OTHER HALF, and why <bdi> per line could never have covered it. Those
// two commits fix an LTR-first line inside an RTL paragraph. The mirror case
// is a Hebrew-FIRST line — correctly RTL, that is not a defect, that is
// Hebrew — with a Latin/numeric run embedded in it. Wrapping the line does
// nothing there, because the line's own direction is already right; the
// isolate has to go around the RUN INSIDE the line. Measured here:
//
//     עשיתי 3×5 @ 60 היום        paints the formula as `60 @ 5×3`
//     האימון בשעה 7:30 - 8:30    paints the times as   `8:30 - 7:30`
//
// The second is the sharper one. A swapped rep scheme is at least strange to
// look at; a swapped pair of class times is a member showing up an hour late
// and never suspecting the screen. Both are fixed by the run-level isolation
// in bidiText(), and both are asserted below against a control that still
// reorders.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT. `עם תווית בלוק (A/B/C/D)`
// was reported as painting `(D/C/B/A)`. It does not, and never did. Measured
// in Chromium and confirmed by screenshot: the bidi algorithm's own
// bracket-pair rule (N0) resolves both parentheses to the paragraph
// direction, mirroring (L4) swaps their glyphs, and a reader sees
// `(A/B/C/D)` exactly as typed. What `paintedText` returns for it —
// `)A/B/C/D(` — is the CODEPOINT at each position, and this file cannot see
// mirroring. So that string is asserted as a NO-REGRESSION case instead: the
// shipped output must paint identically to the pre-fix output, and an
// over-isolating build that swallows the parentheses must not. Writing it up
// as a bug fix would have been the same mistake in a new flavour as
// demanding the app force everything LTR.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. Both commits were proven by hand, once, with
// per-character geometry in Chromium, and neither shipped a test. No unit
// test can replace it: the bidi algorithm never touches the DOM, so the
// text node still reads "21-15-9" in logical order while the screen shows
// something else. `textContent` is correct on the broken build. A unit test
// can at best assert that <bdi> appears at the render sites it already
// knows about, which is a restatement of the diff rather than a check on
// the behaviour, and says nothing at all about a NEW render site added
// later without it - which is precisely how this bug arrived the first
// time (<bdi> already existed in cloud.js, wrapping only @handle).
//
// EVERY ASSERTION HERE IS PAIRED WITH A CONTROL. A geometry check with no
// control is close to worthless - "painted order matches typed order" is
// also true of a string that would never have reordered, on a surface that
// was already LTR, in a container that never inherited dir=rtl. In all
// three cases it passes just as happily against the bug. So each check
// below also builds the PRE-FIX node (same text, no isolation) as a
// sibling of the real one, under identical inherited style, and requires
// it to reorder. If the control ever stops reordering, the sample has gone
// stale and the check is no longer proving anything - that is reported as
// a failure too, deliberately.
//
