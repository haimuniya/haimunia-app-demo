// The install dock, asserted by hit-testing rather than by inspecting the
// DOM — because the DOM was never wrong.
//
// THE BUG (53d6230). #installBanner and #iosInstallBanner were each their
// own `position:fixed; bottom:0; z-index:59` element, 163px tall on an
// 844px screen, while `.tabbar` carried no z-index at all and #bottomBarBtn
// — the primary "רישום סט" save CTA — sat at z-index 20. So the moment
// Chrome offered the install prompt, the banner parked itself on top of the
// entire bottom navigation and the save button. A member who had just been
// invited to install the app could no longer log a set or change tabs. Both
// banners are now ordinary in-flow children of #bottomNavWrap, stacked
// above .bottom-bar and .tabbar, so zero overlap is a consequence of block
// layout rather than of anyone winning a z-index argument.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. test/install-prompt.test.mjs covers the
// beforeinstallprompt handshake thoroughly — defer the native prompt, show
// the banner, replay it on tap, stay dismissed for the session — and none
// of that can see this bug. jsdom has no layout engine: every
// getBoundingClientRect() it returns is 0x0 at (0,0) and
// document.elementFromPoint() is not implemented at all. The banner's
// display flips to "block" in jsdom exactly as it does in Chrome, and the
// save button is present and clickable in the DOM either way. The original
// fix was proven by elementFromPoint hit-tests run by hand, once, and
// nothing has re-run them since.
//
// The failure mode is silent in the worst way: it only appears once the
// browser decides to offer installation, which is a heuristic nobody
// controls and which never fires during ordinary development.
//
// EVERY ASSERTION IS PAIRED WITH A CONTROL, for the same reason as
// bidi-rtl-geometry.mjs: "the save button is tappable" is also true on a
// page with no banner at all. So this script re-creates the pre-fix
// geometry on the live page (position:fixed; bottom:0; z-index:59) and
// requires the hit-tests to FAIL under it. If they ever stop failing, this
// check has stopped proving anything and says so.
//
// Usage:
//   node install-dock-hit-check.mjs                 # local working tree
//   TARGET_URL=<url> node install-dock-hit-check.mjs # a deployed site
